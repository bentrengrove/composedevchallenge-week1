# Puppy Finder

![Workflow result](https://github.com/bentrengrove/composedevchallenge-week1/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
A submission for the #AndroidDevChallenge Jetpack Compose Week 1.
A puppy adoption sample app demonstrating building UI with compose.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I wanted to try out some scroll effects on the detail page. Thanks to recomposition it is very easy to create effects on scroll by referencing 
the scroll state. You can see this with a parallaxing background and alpha fading in and out on the back button.
